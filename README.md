Please refer https://github.com/mikelove/osteoblast-quant for how to process quant data before running Swish and allelic analysis

After running `import_allelic.R` from https://github.com/mikelove/osteoblast-quant, using `swish_eval.R` to run swish on SummarizedExperiment dataset on your resolution of choice (isoform, TSS, gene).

`osteoblast_global_test.R` and `osteoblast_dynamic_test.R` are for allelic imbalance testing using global or dynamic test, after swish.
